Estuaries: These are partially enclosed coastal bodies of water where freshwater from rivers and streams meets and mixes with saltwater from the ocean. They serve as important nurseries for many marine species.

Lagoons: These are shallow bodies of water separated from larger bodies of water (like seas and oceans) by a barrier such as a sandbar or coral reef. They often have a high biodiversity.

Mangroves: These are trees and shrubs that grow in saline coastal habitats in the tropics. They are known for their dense root systems which help in stabilizing the coastline and preventing erosion.

Sand dunes: These are hills of sand built by wind or water flow. They play a crucial role in protecting inland areas from coastal water intrusion.
