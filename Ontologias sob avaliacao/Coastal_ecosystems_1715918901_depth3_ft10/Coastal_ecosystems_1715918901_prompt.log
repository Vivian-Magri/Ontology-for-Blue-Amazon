I'm sorry for the confusion, but "Tertiary dunes" is not a subcategory of "Dune systems". Dune systems can be categorized based on their location and formation process. Some of these categories include coastal dunes, inland dunes, parabolic dunes, barchan dunes, transverse dunes, and longitudinal dunes. 

Coastal dunes: These are formed by the action of sea waves and wind on sandy shores. 

Inland dunes: These are formed by the action of wind on loose, dry, and sandy materials in the interior regions of a landmass.

Parabolic dunes: These are U-shaped mounds of sand with convex noses trailed by elongated arms that are fixed by vegetation.

Barchan dunes: These are crescent-shaped dunes formed by the action of wind predominantly from one direction.

Transverse dunes: These are large fields of dunes that resemble waves, with steep slip faces at right angles to the wind.

Longitudinal dunes: These are long ridges of sand oriented parallel to the prevailing wind, common in deserts.
