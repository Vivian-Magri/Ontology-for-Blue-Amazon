2024-09-06 13:45:19,414 INFO Task-1 Response Atoll reefs: These are circular or oval coral reefs that enclose a central lagoon.

Barrier reefs: These are long, continuous coral reef systems that run parallel to the coastline but are separated from it by a lagoon.

Cays: These are small, low-elevation, sandy islands formed on the surface of coral reefs.

Fringing reefs: These are coral reefs that are directly attached to the shore of an island or continent.

Lagoons: These are shallow bodies of water separated from a larger body of water (such as a sea or ocean) by a barrier such as a coral reef or sandbar.

Mangrove forests: These are coastal wetlands found in tropical and subtropical regions, often associated with coral reefs.

Microatolls: These are circular colonies of coral that can grow in a specific way due to their exposure to air at low tide.

Patch reefs: These are isolated, relatively small reefs that grow up from the open bottom of the island platform or continental shelf.

Ribbon reefs: These are long, narrow, somewhat winding reefs that are usually associated with an outer shelf drop-off.

Seagrass meadows: These are underwater flowering plants that form dense underwater meadows, often found in close association with coral reefs.

Table reefs: These are isolated reefs, often nearly circular and radial, that are flat on top.

Mangrove forests: These are coastal wetlands found in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by the presence of mangrove trees.

Mudflats: These are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by the tides or rivers.

Oyster reefs: These are marine habitats formed by oysters, which cluster together and build up reef-like structures.

River mouths: These are the places where a river flows into a sea, ocean, lake, or reservoir.

Salt marshes: These are coastal ecosystems in the upper coastal intertidal zone, characterized by herbaceous, salt-tolerant vegetation.

Salt pannes and pools: These are shallow depressions that occur in both salt and brackish marshes, where water evaporates and leaves behind a high concentration of salt.

Sand and mudflats: These are coastal environments that are exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide, typically composed of sand, mud or a mixture of the two.

Seagrass beds: These are underwater meadows formed by flowering plants called seagrasses, which are adapted to live in marine environments.

Tidal channels: These are a type of fluvial landform, found in tidal marshes, lagoons, and other tidal environments.

Tidal pools: These are rocky pools that are found in the intertidal zone of a rocky shoreline and are filled with seawater.

Seagrass meadows: These are large underwater areas where a high density of different species of seagrass are found.
