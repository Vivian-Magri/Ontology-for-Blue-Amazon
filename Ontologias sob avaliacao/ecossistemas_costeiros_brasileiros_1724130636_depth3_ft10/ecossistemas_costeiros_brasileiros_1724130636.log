2024-08-20 02:11:47,489 INFO Task-1 Response Bancos de vasa: These are areas of fine sediment in an estuary, often composed of silt and clay.

Baías estuarinas: These are wide inlets of the sea, where the water is typically calmer due to the protection from the main body of water.

Canais de maré: These are channels within an estuary that are influenced by the tide, with water levels rising and falling throughout the day.

Delta de rios: This is the area where a river splits into several smaller channels as it meets the sea, often forming a fan-like shape.

Ilhas-barreira: These are narrow, long islands composed of sand or other loose sediments that run parallel to the mainland and serve to protect the coast from the full force of ocean waves.

Lagoas costeiras: These are bodies of water separated from the ocean by a barrier, such as a sand bar or coral reef, but still connected to the sea through one or more restricted inlets.

Manguezais: These are coastal wetlands found in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by the presence of mangrove trees.

Marismas salgadas: These are coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides.

Planícies de maré: These are flat areas that are regularly flooded by the tides.

Zonas de maré alta: These are areas within an estuary that are covered by water at high tide.

Zonas de maré baixa: These are areas within an estuary that are exposed at low tide.

Zonas de transição: These are areas within an estuary where saltwater from the sea mixes with freshwater from rivers, creating a unique environment that supports a diverse range of species.

Zonas de água profunda: These are the deeper parts of an estuary, often found towards the middle or mouth of the estuary.

Zonas de água salobra: These are areas within an estuary where the water is brackish, meaning it is a mix of fresh and salt water.
