Coral gardens: These are areas of high coral diversity and density.

Fringing reefs: These are coral reefs that are directly attached to the shore of an island or continent.

Microatolls: These are circular colonies of corals that can provide information about sea level changes.

Patch reefs: These are isolated, often circular reefs that grow up from the open bottom of islands and atolls.

Ribbon reefs: These are long, narrow, and winding reefs, often forming the outer edges of a reef system.

Seamounts: These are underwater mountains, often extinct volcanoes, that can host coral reefs on their slopes.

Table reefs: These are flat-topped reefs that form in shallow water.

Coral fish: These are fish species that live in and around coral reefs.

Crustaceans: These are a large group of arthropods, including crabs, lobsters, and shrimps, that live in coral reefs.

Echinoderms: These are marine animals, including starfish and sea urchins, that live in coral reefs.
