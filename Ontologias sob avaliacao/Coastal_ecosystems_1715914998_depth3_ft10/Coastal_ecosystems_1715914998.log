Coastal wetlands: These are areas of land covered with water, either salt, fresh, or somewhere in between, which are located near the coast.

Coral reefs: These are underwater ecosystems characterized by reef-building corals, which are colonies of tiny animals.

Estuaries: These are partially enclosed coastal bodies of water where freshwater from rivers and streams meets and mixes with salt water from the ocean.

Intertidal zones: These are areas that are above water at low tide and under water at high tide.

Kelp forests: These are underwater areas with a high density of kelp, which are large brown algae.

Mangrove forests: These are coastal wetlands found in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by mangroves, a type of tree that grows in saltwater.

Maritime forests: These are coastal woodlands affected by wind and salt spray.

Rocky shores: These are coastal areas characterized by solid rock.

Sandy shores: These are coastal areas characterized by sandy terrain.

Tidal pools: These are rocky pools on the sea shore which are filled with seawater.

Coastal cliffs: These are steep faces formed by wave action on the coastline.

Lagoons: These are shallow bodies of water separated from a larger sea or ocean by a barrier.

Barrier islands: These are coastal landforms and a type of dune system that are exceptionally flat or lumpy areas of sand.

Coastal lakes and ponds: These are bodies of standing water located near the coast.

Coastal plains: These are flat, low-lying pieces of land next to the ocean.

Coastal streams and rivers: These are flowing bodies of water that originate from inland sources but terminate into the ocean.

Estuaries: These are partially enclosed coastal body of brackish water with one or more rivers or streams flowing into it, and with a free connection to the open sea.

Lagoons: These are shallow bodies of water separated from a larger body of water (such as a sea or ocean) by a barrier such as a sandbar, coral reef, or barrier island.

Mangrove forests: These are a type of forest found in coastal areas, characterized by the presence of mangrove species that can tolerate salt or brackish water.

Marshes: These are wetlands that are dominated by herbaceous rather than woody plant species.

Salt pans: These are flat expanses of ground covered with salt and other minerals, usually shining white under the sun.

Salt-tolerant grasslands: These are areas of land dominated by grass or grass-like vegetation that can tolerate high salt concentrations.

Tidal flats: These are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by the tides or rivers, seas, and oceans.

Coastal swamps: These are wetlands found along coasts and are covered by water most of the time.

Mudflats: These are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by the tides or rivers, seas, and oceans.

Salt marshes: These are coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides.

Seagrass meadows: These are underwater meadows formed by seagrass, a type of marine flowering plant.

2024-05-17 00:39:06,962 INFO Task-1 Response Artificial lagoons: These are man-made bodies of water, often created for recreational or industrial purposes.

Atoll lagoons: These are lagoons formed by coral reefs or barrier islands in tropical marine environments.

Barrier island lagoons: These are lagoons that are separated from the ocean by a barrier island.

Brackish lagoons: These are lagoons with a mix of saltwater and freshwater, often found where rivers meet the sea.

Coastal lagoons: These are lagoons located along the coast, often separated from the ocean by a sandbar or barrier island.

Estuarine lagoons: These are lagoons located at the mouth of a river, where freshwater and saltwater mix.

Freshwater lagoons: These are lagoons that contain freshwater, often found inland or where a river meets a lake.

Saltwater lagoons: These are lagoons that contain saltwater, often found along the coast or on islands.

Tidal lagoons: These are lagoons that are significantly affected by the tides, with water levels rising and falling throughout the day.

Barrier lagoons: These are lagoons that are separated from the sea or ocean by a physical barrier such as a sandbar or coral reef.

Deep lagoons: These are lagoons that are significantly deeper than most, often due to geological features or human intervention.

Permanent lagoons: These are lagoons that contain water year-round, as opposed to temporary lagoons which may dry up during certain seasons.

Saline lagoons: These are lagoons with a high salt content, often found in arid regions or where evaporation rates are high.

Shallow lagoons: These are lagoons that are not very deep, often due to the presence of sandbars or other shallow features.

Temporary lagoons: These are lagoons that only contain water during certain times of the year, often due to seasonal rainfall or flooding.

Coral reef lagoons: These are lagoons that are surrounded by coral reefs, often found in tropical marine environments.

Mangrove lagoons: These are lagoons that are surrounded by mangrove forests, often found in tropical and subtropical regions.

Oxbow lagoons: These are lagoons that are formed when a river changes course, leaving behind a body of water in the old river channel.

Slough lagoons: These are lagoons that are formed in low-lying areas, often as a result of flooding or changes in water levels.
