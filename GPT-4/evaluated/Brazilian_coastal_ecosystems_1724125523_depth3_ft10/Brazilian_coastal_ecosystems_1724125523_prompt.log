These ecosystems include various habitats such as mangroves, sand dunes, lagoons, estuaries, and coral reefs, each hosting a unique array of flora and fauna. They play crucial roles in climate regulation, nutrient cycling, and providing resources and services for human livelihoods.
Lagoons: These are shallow bodies of water separated from larger bodies of water (like seas and oceans) by a barrier such as a sandbar or coral reef. They often have a high biodiversity.
Artificial lagoons: These are lagoons that are man-made.
"Lagoons" is a subcategory of "Brazilian coastal ecosystems". "Artificial lagoons" is a subcategory of "Lagoons". Are there any generally accepted subcategories of "Artificial lagoons"? Answer only with yes or no.
