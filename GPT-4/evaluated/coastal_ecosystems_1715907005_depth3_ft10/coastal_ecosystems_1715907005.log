2024-05-16 22:19:29,087 INFO Task-1 Response Brackish marshes: These are wetlands that form in areas where freshwater mixes with saltwater, often found near estuaries.

Fjords: These are long, narrow inlets with steep sides or cliffs, created by glacial activity and often found in estuarine environments.

Intertidal zones: These are areas that are above water at low tide and under water at high tide, often found in estuaries.

Lagoons: These are shallow bodies of water separated from a larger body of water (such as a sea or ocean) by a barrier such as a sandbar, coral reef, or barrier island.

Mangrove forests: These are coastal wetlands found in tropical and subtropical regions, characterized by the presence of mangrove trees.

Mudflats: These are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by the tides or rivers, often found in estuaries.

Oyster reefs: These are marine habitats formed by oysters, which cluster together and build up reef structures.

River mouths: These are the places where a river flows into a sea, ocean, lake, or reservoir, often forming an estuary.

Salt marshes: These are coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides.

Salt pannes and pools: These are low, flat areas found in coastal salt marshes, where water pools.

Sand and mudflats: These are coastal environments characterized by flat, sandy or muddy areas that are flooded at high tide and exposed at low tide.

Seagrass beds: These are underwater meadows formed by seagrasses, which are flowering plants that grow in marine environments.

Subtidal zones: These are the areas of the marine environment that are always submerged, even at the lowest tide.

Tidal channels: These are channels of water in a wetland, through which the tide flows.

Tidal pools: These are rocky pools on the seashore that are filled with seawater.

Bar-built estuaries: These are estuaries formed when a barrier such as a sandbar or barrier island separates a section of the sea or ocean.

Coastal plain estuaries: These are estuaries formed by the sea level rising and filling an existing river valley.

Fjord-type estuaries: These are estuaries formed in a U-shaped valley formed by glacial activity.

Freshwater estuaries: These are estuaries where a river or stream with freshwater meets a lake.

Fully mixed estuaries: These are estuaries where the freshwater and seawater mix completely.

Partially mixed estuaries: These are estuaries where the freshwater and seawater mix partially.

Salt-wedge estuaries: These are estuaries where a wedge of saltwater, denser than freshwater, extends inland from the sea.

Tectonic estuaries: These are estuaries formed by the subsidence or sinking of land due to tectonic activity.

Tidal estuaries: These are estuaries where the tides have a significant impact on the mixing of freshwater and seawater.

Mangrove forests: These are coastal wetlands that are home to trees and shrubs that grow in saline coastal sediment habitats in the tropics and subtropics.

Marshes: These are wetlands that are dominated by herbaceous rather than woody plant species.

Mudflats: These are coastal wetlands that form when mud is deposited by tides or rivers.

Salt marshes: These are coastal wetlands that are flooded and drained by salt water brought in by the tides.

Saltwater swamps: These are coastal wetlands that are dominated by woody plants and are influenced by tides.

Seagrass meadows: These are underwater ecosystems formed by seagrasses, which are flowering plants that grow in marine environments.

Tidal flats: These are flat, marshy, sandy or muddy areas exposed at low tide and submerged at high tide.

Coastal dunes: These are hills of sand built by wind or water flow near the coastline.

Coastal swamps: These are swamps that are found along the coastal areas, where they are influenced by the sea tides.

Coral reefs: These are underwater ecosystems characterized by reef-building corals.

Salt pans: These are flat expanses of ground covered with salt and other minerals, usually found in deserts and are the result of water evaporation.
