2024-05-15 21:13:42,516 INFO Task-1 Response High intertidal zone: The uppermost part of the intertidal zone that is exposed to air during low tide.
Low intertidal zone: The lower part of the intertidal zone that is submerged under water for most of the time.
Mid intertidal zone: The middle section of the intertidal zone that experiences both wet and dry conditions during tidal changes.
Boulder fields: Areas within rocky shores characterized by large boulders that provide habitat for various intertidal organisms.
Intertidal zone: The area that is alternately covered and uncovered by the tides, supporting a diverse range of species adapted to changing conditions.
Rocky cliffs: Vertical or steep rocky formations along the shoreline that provide habitat for specialized intertidal species.
Tide pools: Depressions in rocky shores that retain water at low tide, creating unique habitats for a variety of intertidal organisms.
