Carbon sequestration: Mangroves store large amounts of carbon in their biomass and sediment, helping to mitigate climate change by removing carbon dioxide from the atmosphere.
Coastal protection: Mangroves act as a natural barrier, reducing the impact of coastal erosion, storm surges, and tsunamis on coastal communities.
Fisheries support: Mangroves serve as nurseries and feeding grounds for many fish and shellfish species, supporting local fisheries and livelihoods.
Tourism and recreation: Mangroves attract tourists and provide opportunities for recreational activities such as birdwatching, kayaking, and eco-tourism.
